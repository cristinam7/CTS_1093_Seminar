Project title: Book Swap Platform

Description of the problem to be solved by prototype approach: The best way that users could filter books is by title, since most readers are 
		particularly interested in one topic or category of books. When a book is added by one user that wishes to give it away, 
		the same Book Category is created every time and it is time consuming due to the database request. 
		The solution we are looking for is to be able to use the same category created for previous books for the new ones in a way that
		does not affect the application's performance. 
		

Advantages: 
-it prevents from doing a lot of requests over the database
-the object are created very fast through cloning, almost imediatly
-when objects are created using this approach, the constructor is not called

Disadvantages: 
-shallow copies might be created which could lead to strange behavior of the app
