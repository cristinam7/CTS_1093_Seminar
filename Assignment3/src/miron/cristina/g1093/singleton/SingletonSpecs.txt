Project title: Book Swap Platform

Project purpose: The project is an actual web application where users can create an account and post books that they are willing to lend out or 
search for books that they would like to have without having to pay money for it. If it finds a book that is appealing an would like to get it, 
one user can contact the other and establish a meeting point. The platform creates a community where its users can swap among them. 

Description of the problem solved by singleton approach: All the data are posted and retrieve from a database, for which we need to create a unique
connection shared by all the users. 

Advantages: 
-centralized management of the resource
-an unique instance of the database connection is created, duplicates are not allowed
-can be used with lazy instantiation which only created the object when it is needed, and not before that

Disadvantages: 
-the getInstance method is declared asynchronous, which might cause unexpected behavior of the app 
-the performance of the application may be affected because the threads wait for the others to finish and if a lot of requests are received at once
it might become a bottleneck for the app
