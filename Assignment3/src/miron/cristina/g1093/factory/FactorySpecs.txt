Project title: Book Swap Platform

Description of the problem to be solved by factory approach: The items that can be posted by users on this platform can be of different kinds, 
	and another classification, besides the one after the topic they approach could be after their type. 
	The 4 main types of books that can be added are dictionaries, magazines, encyclopedias or classical books. 
	We need to have a way of creating these different types in a centralized manner. Each of the type must have a title and a 
	field, and each type has separately a distinct attribute from one another.
		
Advantages:
-more book types can be added to the factory very easily
-the objects are not created straight through constructors, factory methods are used 
 	
Disadvantages:
-new objects can't be created
-all constructors are private so the classes cannot be extended
