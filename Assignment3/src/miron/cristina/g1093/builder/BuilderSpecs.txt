Project title: Book Swap Platform

Description of the problem: The users of this web app have the possibility to post or search for books. 
							Any book has multiple attributes,in order to provide as much useful information as possible
							to those looking for it, but only two fields are considered mandatory 
							since they are the two main ways they can search for books: by title or category.
	
Advantages:
 -very useful in creating complex objects(with a lot of attributes) because they can be created independent of their components
 -it gives a lot of flexibility in object creation, since not all the fields need to be initialized when the object is created

 	
Disadvantages:
-attributes might be left uninitialized
-the uninitialized fields might cause null pointer exception later in the program if those fields are accessed
